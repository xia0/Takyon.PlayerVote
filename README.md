# Before Installing
## Version 3.1.0 and higher
To enable commands being sent to chat you need to add ```-enablechathooks``` to your startup args!  
Server: ```\Titanfall2\ns_startup_args_dedi.txt```  
Client(Private Match): ```\Titanfall2\ns_startup_args.txt```  

## Mod Conflicts
For **Flipside** set pv_maps to "mp_glitch", disable mapvote and skip!
There may be conflicts with other server mods which write messages to players as there can only be one message displayed! Namely **Unholy Trinity**, **Karma's Admin Abuse** and **RCON**. Basically every mod that sends a HUD-message. If there are conflicts either make one mod stop or disable it. If you need help hmu on Discord.

## sv_cheats
It is recommended to have ```sv_cheats``` set to ```0``` at all times, however if you plan to use my mod this is a must as players will be able to kick others and access admin commands!

# Contributing
The main branch is only updated with minor changes between releases! The newest features are always in a seperate branch and will be merged with main on release. Versioned branches might have bugs or other issues till release. Once released they should be fully functional and will be merged with main.

## How to contribute
[Here](https://github.com/ScureX/Takyon.PlayerVote/projects/1) you can see planned features/bugs and their current status.

> ### Contribute Code
> The main branch will always work so it's safe to implement stuff on top of it, it will be merged with a versioned branch and then released. You could also build features on versioned branches, however this might result in more merge conflicts.

> ### Contribute Ideas
> You can open a [Discussion](https://github.com/ScureX/Takyon.PlayerVote/discussions/categories/ideas) and share your thoughts on certain features, suggest improvements or new features. You can also DM me on Discord: ```Takyon Scure#6969```

# Commands
## !help
### Usage: [!help]  [!help command]
Shows the player who requested it all available commands.  
If they added a command after the usage of said command will be displayed.

## !skip | !rtv
### Usage: [!skip]  [!skip force] | [!rtv]  [!rtv force]
This lets the player vote to skip the map. It sends a message to everyone showing how many people want to skip and that they can skip with !skip. If half the Players voted to skip, the game time will be set to 1 second, allowing stats to be seen and switching to a new map.

Users cannot vote twice as their name is being tracked. They will get a message that they have already voted.  

Votes are reset on map change.

!skip force only works for people declared as admins in the andminNames array. This lets them skip without voting.

## !kick
### Usage: [!kick name]  [!kick name force] | [!yes]  [!no]

Lets people vote on kicking a player by typing !yes or !no. By default at least 90% of people need to have voted and more than half of those have to vote for kicking. (This can be changed)

Not the full name has to be given, just enough to identify a player.

!kick name force only works for people declared as admins in the andminNames array. This lets them kick without voting.

This feature can be disabled, even disallowing admins to kick.

There cannot be two votes at the same time. Mabye adding a time limit in the future?

## !extend
### Usage: [!extend]  [!extend force]

Lets people vote on extending the map to play longer. (The time added can be changed)

By default the map can only be extended once. (This can be changed)

Force can only be used by admins, and will always extend the map.

Shows the user the servers rules, specified in ```takyon_rules.nut```. Change or disable these!

## !sendrules |!sr
### Usage: [!sendrules]  [!sr]

## !msg
### Usage: [!msg playerName message]
Lets an admin send an anonymous direct message to the player. This might help with toxic users or if you do not want to embarrass them publicly, which may lead to more problems.

Not the full name has to be given, just enough to identify a player.

# Adding rules
Rules can be added in `mod\scripts\vscripts\takyon_rules.nut` below the "add rules here" section.

To make a new Rule add this below the other rules:

```string rule99 = "[99] this is a rule"```

Make sure it's getting diplayed by adding it to "rules". Add a ```+``` behind the last ```\n``` then add your rule with:

```rule99 + "\n"```
